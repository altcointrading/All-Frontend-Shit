        <title>Bitfinex is not planning to resolve the banking issues for retail customers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Phill G. Potter of Bitfinex (PGP) did an interview on Whalepool’s teamspeak just now. PGP used to be a regular on there but over the past few weeks there was no sight of him - it is not so hard to imagine he’d be bombarded with questions for hours the minute he’d log in these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the interview he spoke about the Bcash distribution, the new altcoins that are getting listed on Bitfinex and the ongoing fiat withdrawal issues - the banking issues being the only point where he actually said something surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you know, some months ago Bitfinex started having issues with their banking routes and had to stop fiat withdrawals. That also influenced people who weren’t using the fiat withdrawal and also those who didn’t even trade on Bitfinex because Bitfinex was removed from indexes for futures markets because an exchange without fiat withdrawals is bound to have bullish bias on cryptocurrencies that has nothing to do with the state of the market. Until now Bitfinex people kept making it clear that this fiat issue was being worked on and hopefully new routes would be set up. In the meantime, withdrawals were enabled for several bigger customers and for people with access to banking in Taiwan which is where Bitfinex banks. Traders took this for a good sign and were expecting the situation would be back in normal soon. Today though PGP explained that the banking issues won’t change from what is it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to PGP, it wouldn’t pay off to Bitfinex to enable withdrawals for average the retail trader. He said the banks “don’t like to see many small transactions each day, it is harder to do AML/KYC for the USD routes and other fiat currencies, too”. Apparently enabling crypto-fiat routes for the retail would lead to more disruptions in the future anyway so it is not worth it for Bitfinex to do it. The way it works these days is if you are a big enough whale you already have fiat routes enabled, unless you’re new in which case you should talk to customer service. PGP explained the banking will probably stay available for the (few) regulars as they are KYC’d and known, while others will have to put up with crypto withdrawals and realize the profit via Kraken or Bitstamp if they want to. Effectively Bitfinex is trying to outsource this hassle to the exchanges that don’t have their fiat routes blocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the other things that PGP was talking about was the Bcash distribution the rules of which were changed after the distribution happened: ,,There is a lot of amateur laywers on Reddit but we have received no legal claims or complaints,” he explained and added a justification - the policy was changed so that people who hedged in such a way they didn’t have exposure to BTC would get no BCH, in other words in favor of people who had a position in BTC. Bitfinex always reserves the right to change their terms at any moment so there is not much you can do if you tried to game the system and were caught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PGP’s explanation as to why Bitfinex suddenly lists tokens that are unheard of amounted to &lt;em&gt;there’s money in it&lt;/em&gt; although it was said in better words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post will be updated with a link to the YouTube video of the teamspeak interview once it’s uploaded. To catch the next event connect to &lt;a href=&quot;https://whalepool.io/connect/teamspeak&quot;&gt;https://whalepool.io/connect/teamspeak&lt;/a&gt; - the rumor has it John Bollinger will be coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Anonymous coins on the Apple App Store</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Anonymous coins have always been a concern for the App Store as allegedly they didn’t want to be linked to illicit activities. If you are a DASH holder though, your situation regarding wallets is a bit less bleak than what’s normal for crypto right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new official DASH wallet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DASH wallet app was released just yesterday to the Apple App Store. It is a cryptocurrency wallet specifically for DASH and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bankinnovation.net/2017/07/after-long-wait-apple-oks-dash-wallet-for-ios-app-store/&quot;&gt;was created by the DASH Foundation, so there is no reason to worry about scams and counterfeit apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dash-wallet/id1206647026?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;Link to the DASH wallet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Z-Cash was approved for the App Store too, but is only available via Jaxx&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zcash was the first anonymous cryptocurrency to get Apple’s blessings. There was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.z.cash/t/zcash-and-jaxx-announce-zec-approved-and-live-on-ios-appstore/15227&quot;&gt;press release campaign in April 2017&lt;/a&gt; announcing Apple approved ZEC for App Store, and Jaxx integrated it. Right now the Jaxx wallet for iOS from April 2017 supports both DASH and ZEC, &lt;strong&gt;even though the description of the app on iTunes doesn’t say so&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jaxx was planning to integrate ZCASH &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jaxx_io/status/785833459772162048&quot;&gt;unce upon a time even along with Monero&lt;/a&gt; - but that doesn’t look very likely anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, the problem with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altcointrading.net/jaxx-vulnerability&quot;&gt;Jaxx is the security vulnerability of Jaxx desktop&lt;/a&gt; version. Recently there was also a problem with the servers on which the backend is running, and people were &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jaxx_io/status/883849413294256128&quot;&gt;unable to access their ETC funds for the whole weekend&lt;/a&gt;. There was no warning in the app, it just showed old data apparetly from a backup, and the app was frozen - not a nice way to persuade people to store their monies in it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, although the iOS app is not suffering from the vulnerability of the desktop wallet, it is currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jaxx-blockchain-wallet/id1084514516?mt=8&quot;&gt;collecting negative reviews on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monero people, don’t get ahead of yourselves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monero’s situation is even better! There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/monero-wallet-by-freewallet/id1126426159?mt=8&quot;&gt;Monero wallet approved by the App Store&lt;/a&gt; right now but as slick as it looks, it is a scam. It has been a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/5lrnw8/anyone_use_the_monero_app_on_the_apple_app_store/&quot;&gt;known scam for at least six months&lt;/a&gt; yet it is still available on the wonderful Apple App Store with diligent app reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ETH multisig hack</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a reason for the selloff, if you are looking for one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFHvB86W0AEOnX0.jpg&quot; style=&quot;max-width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some multisig wallets with contracts for ICOs created with certain versions of Parity are vulnerable and getting drained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far all ICO money for Edgeless Casino, aeternity and swarm.city is gone. It is 153k ETH which was worth about $32M when the heist started. At the moment it is around $30M. &lt;a href=&quot;https://etherscan.io/address/0xb3764761e297d6f121e79c32a65829cd1ddb4d32#internaltx&quot;&gt;This is where the coins were sent to&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bug has not been fixed yet so the draining might be going to continue for a while longer, unless money is moved out of vulnerable wallets in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The vulnerability is a serious one, allegedly one only needs the public key and certain kind of metadata and that is enough to regenerate the wallet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://press.swarm.city/parity-multisig-wallet-exploit-hits-swarm-city-funds-statement-by-the-swarm-city-core-team-d1f3929b4e4e&quot;&gt;Some of the funds were secured by ways of the same hack by a group of white hackers.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Swarm: A swift response from a whitehat hacker group used the same exploit to drain many other project’s parity multisig wallets, in order to protect them from theft. This group was able to save over 377,000 ETH. Unfortunately the 44,055 ETH that was in Swarm City’s wallet is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Black hat hacker wallet address with stolen ether: https://etherscan.io/address/0xb3764761e297d6f121e79c32a65829cd1ddb4d32&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;White hat wallet address with preserved ether: https://etherscan.io/address/0x1dba1131000664b884a1ba238464159892252d3a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bug has been fixed - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/paritytech/parity/commit/e06a1e8dd9cfd8bf5d87d24b11aee0e8f6ff9aeb&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Where to trade blackbytes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Two days ago, on the full moon, there was a blackbytes airdrop. If you signed a message with a BTC address before the deadline on 9th of July, you received free &lt;strong&gt;bytes&lt;/strong&gt; and some hours later also some &lt;strong&gt;blackbytes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the bytes can be traded on &lt;a href=&quot;https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-GBYTE&quot;&gt;Bittrex (by millions as GBYTE)&lt;/a&gt;, the blackbytes aren’t traded anywhere. To trade these for bytes you need to sign up to the byteball slack channel &lt;a href=&quot;http://slack.byteball.org/&quot;&gt;via the autoinviter here&lt;/a&gt; and head to #trading_blackbyte channel. The channel has a bot that works as an order book by Gigabyte per Gigablackbyte:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://image.prntscr.com/image/D2NJV0HoTAqCiTrhnt38OQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently the top of the ask book is at 0.01290 GB/GBB and top of the bid book at 0.02008 GB/GBB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gigabytes per bitcoin are trading at Bittrex around 0.24 BTC ($585).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;about-byteball&quot;&gt;About Byteball&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Byteball is a payment network that makes it easy to set conditional payments - &lt;em&gt;finalize payment only if condition is met&lt;/em&gt; - similar to ethereum smart contracts but more user-friendly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://wiki.byteball.org/uploads/slackjore/bind-400.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way transactions are confirmed is from the high level similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altcointrading.net/iota&quot;&gt;IOTA’s tangle&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Transactions created by users are cryptographically linked to each other, and once you add your new transaction, other users start adding theirs on top of yours, and the number of other transactions that link to your transaction grows like snowball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In byteball this is called DAG (directed acyclic graph) - every new transaction references one or more earlier ones by including and signing their hashes. By including its parents, each new transaction also indirectly includes and confirms all parents of the parents, parents of the parents of the parents, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The supply is capped, there is no mining:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The total number of bytes is 10^15, all bytes were issued in the genesis transaction. Since the fees paid are returned into the circulation, the money supply will remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between bytes and blackbytes is that blackbytes have enhanced privacy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Private payments can be made using blackbytes, a cash-like untraceable currency. Its transactions are not visible on the public database that shows all payments made with (white)bytes. Blackbytes are sent peer-to-peer instead in an encrypted chat session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1608859.0&quot;&gt;Read more at bitcointalk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;byteball-airdrops&quot;&gt;Byteball airdrops&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you didn’t catch the first airdrop, there will be another one the next full moon (August 7th) - &lt;a href=&quot;https://byteball.org&quot;&gt;byteball.org&lt;/a&gt; has a countdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-to-get-into-the-next-airdrop&quot;&gt;How to get into the next airdrop&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enter the byteball giveaway you need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://byteball.org/#download&quot;&gt;download byteball wallet&lt;/a&gt; and from it &lt;a href=&quot;byteball:A2WMb6JEIrMhxVk+I0gIIW1vmM3ToKoLkNF8TqUV5UvX@byteball.org/bb#0000&quot;&gt;enter the chat window with the transition bot&lt;/a&gt;. The bot will tell you to first state your byteball address, then your bitcoin addresses each followed by a message signed with that address. The signed message must contain only your byteball address.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Economics of Proof of Stake</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-gist-of-pos&quot;&gt;The gist of PoS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mailchimpfix&quot;&gt; &lt;amp-iframe width=&quot;400px&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; layout=&quot;fixed&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-modals allow-popups allow-forms&quot; src=&quot;https://amp2disqus.netlify.com/altcointrading/signup.html&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img layout=&quot;fill&quot; src=&quot;/img/ads/ad-placeholder.jpg&quot; placeholder=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/amp-iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In PoW (Proof of work) the longest chain is valid, as in the one with most &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;. In PoS the one that is agreed upon in betting &lt;em&gt;consensus&lt;/em&gt; is accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the proposed version of proof of stake in ETH, stakers make bets on which block will be included in the blockchain. The block that is backed up by most bets is the winning one. The betting is automated and has several rounds as the odds of reaching consensus at each block changes. The initial bets are small, when a leader starts to emerge the bets grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The betting happens automatically. All the staker has to do is to put a full node online and lock up their stake for four months. In the last published at least 32 ETH is needed to participate in staking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;will-staking-pay-off&quot;&gt;Will staking pay off?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one wants to focus only on profits, staking could be compared to lending at an exchange. Bets made on the winning block get rewarded, the rest is lost. That means there will have to be losses too, but thanks to the system of several betting rounds the losses should be small - the bets start small and move higher once there’s higher confidence regarding the winning block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is simply lots of tiny gambles with the odds in the staker’s favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a counterparty risk as well though: staker loses his lot if it appears that he is engaged in an illicit anti-network activity. This ban from staking is for Vitalik and his crew to judge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another small risk comes from volatility of ETH - should a big dump be obvious, staker cannot withdraw his money to sell, but this can be hedged with the help of derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But practically, staking could be more profitable than lending on an exchange, just probably not for individuals at home as they’d have to run a full node. Running a full node costs energy, maintenance and bandwidth and we all know that even though setting up a parity wallet to make a basic transaction is a matter of an hour max, the full ethereum blockchain has a fat ass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There probably is an incentive for the ETH fanbois to prefer staking to lending on an exchange though, because as stakers they would be “helping the good cause”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that Vitalik is aware of these sentiments that are outside of economics, but it is anyone’s guess if he has plans to use them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;/img/daddyvitalik/IsHeForReal.png&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;border&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/img/daddyvitalik/IsHeForReal.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; width=&quot;700px&quot; height=&quot;360px&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: From Vitalik’s medium.com post &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/a-proof-of-stake-design-philosophy-506585978d51&quot;&gt;“A Proof of Stake Design Philosophy”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-is-it-really-with-the-centralization-and-unfair-advantages&quot;&gt;How is it really with the centralization and unfair advantages&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most promoted advantage of proof of stake is that it fights centralization of mining that seems to always emerge in PoW after some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PoW&lt;/strong&gt;: If you are late to the party or don’t have access to cheap electricity or don’t have enough capital to constantly upgrade your mining equipment, your mining profits will not pay for your expenses - at least not until your coin increases in price, and if you should be waiting for that it would make more sense to simply trade. In addition to this you are fighting mining cartels that might be engaged in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ie53/publications/btcProcFC.pdf&quot;&gt;selfish mining&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Selfish Mining”: A group of miners can form a pool that behaves as single agent […] following some strategy. Selfish-Mine allows a pool &lt;strong&gt;of sufficient size&lt;/strong&gt; to obtain a &lt;strong&gt;revenue larger than its ratio of mining power&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The key insight behind the selfish mining strategy is to force &lt;strong&gt;the honest miners into performing wasted computations on the stale public branch&lt;/strong&gt;. […] Selfish miners achieve this goal by selectively revealing their mined blocks to invalidate the honest miners’ work. Approximately speaking, the selfish mining pool &lt;strong&gt;keeps its mined blocks private&lt;/strong&gt;, secretly bifurcating the blockchain and creating a private branch. Meanwhile, the honest miners continue mining on the shorter, public branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PoS&lt;/strong&gt;:
If ETH main office says you cheat, you lose your stake. If ETH main office says you are honest, you get transaction fees and the block reward. Your profit is proportional to how much you stake, nothing else - there is no difficulty, there will be some hardware maintenance but not as much as with PoW. If you have more starting capital you will earn more, but proportionally more - you are not supposed to get an edge when you have more money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it bluntly, if everything should work as drafted it would mean that the business of &lt;em&gt;staking&lt;/em&gt; would not scale the way the business of &lt;em&gt;mining&lt;/em&gt; does, but  while at the same time &lt;em&gt;staking&lt;/em&gt; would not pay off for small individual participants, similarly as with &lt;em&gt;mining&lt;/em&gt; of well established coins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of anti-capitalistic compromise understandably causes some stir, but Vitalik is clearly bigger than that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to add to this: it is not even quite clear that PoS is really free from all this unfairness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s  not clear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Staker A owns 100 ETH and stakes all 100 of it. Staker B owns 100 000 ETH and stakes all of it but into 1000 different accounts. Has Staker B has 1000x chance to find the block over Staker A?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What if all the stakers are the same staker? How would anyone know?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answers to this would &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; be that this is an attack, there might be a fork - you know the drill. It is unclear how would this be detected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If a staker-attacker has an ETH short equal or more than his stake and is the majority network validator, then the staker-attacker has nothing to lose. The currency will lose in value but the staker-attacker has the short to profit from the drop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is an argument that it is not possible to short this much ETH on any exchange, it might be possible in the future if there are more highly leveraged futures or option markets available. One could also long Alt/ETH pairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The “nothing at stake” problem: In the case of a consensus failure stakers have nothing to lose by voting for multiple blockchain-histories, which prevents the consensus from ever resolving. Because there is little cost in working on several chains (unlike in proof-of-work systems), anyone can abuse this problem “for free”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one Ethereum implementation called &lt;em&gt;slasher&lt;/em&gt;, this behavior would fall under “cheating” and would lead to the loss of the stake, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/economic-modeling/tree/master/casper&quot;&gt;but slasher introduces other problems&lt;/a&gt; - what if most staking nodes drop out (blockchain generation freezes, called “ice age”) and what if there is no consensus (blockchain generation gets stuck). You can read the whole mildly technical explanation &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/economic-modeling/tree/master/casper&quot;&gt;at ethereum’s github&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ&quot;&gt;Casper should work with some form of slashing conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Ethereum roadmap, &lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/609yjl/vladzamfir_if_the_price_of_ether_stays_high_i/df4r7hq/&quot;&gt;the switch to PoS is planned for June 2018&lt;/a&gt; (the switch has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/When-will-ethereum-switch-to-proof-of-stake&quot;&gt;postponed several times&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;strong&gt;At this stage, of course PoS in ETH is not ready yet,&lt;/strong&gt; but what is the hype all about, really?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PoS is not convenient for big miners, it is not convenient for hobby miners/stakers, it is not convenient for traders &amp;amp; holders because it introduces new possible problems and reasons for forks - but it’s the next big thing because it is a system that is “more fair” and also “eco friendly”? Quite serious there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly it does not really scream advantages, other than what relates to “Vitalik philosophy”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;/img/daddyvitalik/VitalikTheLordSavior.png&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;border&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/img/daddyvitalik/VitalikTheLordSavior.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; width=&quot;700px&quot; height=&quot;360px&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Trezor might be getting Monero, too</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Could it be that Trezor people don’t want to lose their customers for Ledger?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mid June 2017 the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altcointrading.net/ledger-monero&quot;&gt;CTO of Ledger wallet said on Reddit they would implement Monero, someday&lt;/a&gt;. There is no ETA yet and probably will not be any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, Slush of Satoshi Labs (the company behind Trezor wallet) is probably not willing to be left behind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/06/28/slush-monero.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/slushcz/status/783654392071323649&quot;&gt;Link to tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any time scale of this is as unclear as with the Ledger wallet though:&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/68ulcx/would_raising_money_for_the_development_of/dh2kril/&quot;&gt; Slush apparently doesn’t have time to work on this so he is looking for someone from the Monero community to do the code.&lt;/a&gt; There already is an older implementation of Monero into the Trezor firmware and it needs modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://steemit.com/programming/@arcitecx/bounty-5-btc-for-xmr-implementation-on-trezor&quot;&gt;According to a post from Steemit, Slush apparently offers 5 BTC for this gig.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gary Vee on Ethereum</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneur and influencer Gary Vaynerchuk on Ethereum:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ethereum’s got huge upside […] I still know that there’s so many people that know so much more, but here’s what I would say: It can’t lose over time. So I don’t know how that manifests but it’s binary. It’s going to work over time. Here’s what I don’t know - I don’t know how I think because I haven’t done my homework and what governments will do about it. [Ethereum is backed by big companies] - Big companies are much smaller than governments. So I don’t know that. The reason I love Ethereum is that it’s so much more agnostic than a currency. […] So overall I think it’s gonna work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/mkR4-ZDAWcI&quot;&gt;On Youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/Ethereum/permalink/1221683854624326/&quot;&gt;another version on Facebook in the Ethereum group&lt;/a&gt; that is longer, Gary goes on to hint that maybe if the crypto space continues to grow someday in the future he’s going to say ‘You know what, fuck it,’ and go full on crypto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5r4p9h&quot;&gt;screencast of the missing part&lt;/a&gt; from the private video from Facebook:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gary Vee has been asked many times about bitcoin in his Youtube ask show but every time he simply said he understands neither crypto nor the regulations hence he can’t talk about that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lending in the time of chain split</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Even if you are die hard altcoiner, if you are trading altcoins actively on Poloniex or Bittrex you definitely have some bitcoins. And if you sometimes take a break from trades,
maybe you loan them out for interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t lend out your bitcoin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://1august.org&quot;&gt;there is a new website that was shared on reddit that is dedicated to explaining the 1st of August thing&lt;/a&gt; - the day when the bitcoin network might split (but might not). The chain split might occur but might not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general rule is if you have your bitcoins in a wallet where you own your private keys (&lt;a href=&quot;https://electrum.org/#download&quot;&gt;Electrum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.trezor.io/?a=fany@tutanota.com&quot;&gt;Trezor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ledgerwallet.com/r/e274?path=/products/ledger-nano-s&quot;&gt;Ledger&lt;/a&gt; to name the best) you will be able to extract both chains after the split.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mailchimpfix&quot;&gt; &lt;amp-iframe width=&quot;400px&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; layout=&quot;fixed&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-modals allow-popups allow-forms&quot; src=&quot;https://amp2disqus.netlify.com/altcointrading/signup.html&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img layout=&quot;fill&quot; src=&quot;/img/ads/ad-placeholder.jpg&quot; placeholder=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/amp-iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have your bitcoins on an exchange but &lt;strong&gt;not in an open margin position or lent out&lt;/strong&gt;, you should &lt;strong&gt;probably&lt;/strong&gt; get both chains automatically. The exchange is however not forced to support both chains though, but there are no statements available regarding this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As of today, exchanges haven’t released statements regarding the possible network split in August so the only available information is their statements from the possible hard fork of core vs unlimited in March 2017. This post will be updated once there are statements available and newsletter subscribers will get a notification, as usually.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;if-you-dont-lend-your-coins&quot;&gt;If you don’t lend your coins&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you don’t have to have bitcoins on the exchange and you don’t want to sell them, your best bet is to have them in your wallet where you easily control the private key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can always go for &lt;a href=&quot;https://electrum.org/#download&quot;&gt;Electrum&lt;/a&gt; which doesn’t have the new hip frontend design but is actually easy to use while it also stood the test of time without hacks and heists. If you don’t have a cold storage (hardware wallet) you are probably too late ordering it now. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ledgerwallet.com/r/e274?path=/products/ledger-nano-s&quot;&gt;Ledger Nano S&lt;/a&gt; is sold out on backorder, ETA September 2017 which is too late. As for &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.trezor.io/?a=fany@tutanota.com&quot;&gt;Trezor&lt;/a&gt;, some amount of Trezors is available right now (for a markup) or you can opt in for the normally-priced backorder Trezor (ETA August 2017 – too late).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;if-you-make-money-lending-to-the-people-who-borrow-to-gamble&quot;&gt;If you make money lending to the people who borrow to gamble&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is what exchanges have put out regarding possible chain splits. There were statements when the whole Bitcoin Core vs Bitcoin Unlimited affair was going on, but the problem was essentially the same: the network split.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;poloniex&quot;&gt;Poloniex&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5zz0a9/poloniex_our_position_on_the_possible_hard_fork/&quot;&gt;Poloniex - Our position on possible hard fork&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you have Bitcoin on loan at the time of the fork, you do not have it on balance and therefore you cannot receive corresponding Bitcoin Unlimited. The terms of the loan dictate that you will receive the same number and type of coins you loaned within X days plus the agreed upon interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Spot traders unambiguously own their purchases, and are the rightful recipients of the coins on the new chain and they can do with them what they like, whether that is selling them to others or taking them off of the platform entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR;&lt;/strong&gt; Both coins listed. If you lend out your bitcoins you don’t have them in your wallet, therefore you cannot receive the coins of the new chain. If you hold bitcoins in your wallet (spot or margin), you receive coins from both chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poloniex is the only exchange that has this kind of lending policy for hard fork, maybe it has something to do with how the exchange engines are coded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bitfinex&quot;&gt;Bitfinex&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/62a1pv/how_bitfinex_will_handle_a_hardfork_with_respect/&quot;&gt;How Bitfinex will handle hard fork&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is for the split into BTC-Core and BTC-Unlimited but the procedure is likely to be the same for the scaling split:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the event of a hardfork that results in a chain split, Bitfinex and other major exchanges—such as Poloniex, Kraken, and GDAX—are faced with the challenge of resolving complex accounting issues in margin trading. Ideally, each exchange would agree to a uniform and coherent methodology; however, each serves different audiences and have different market structures, making a universal solution unworkable. For example, Bitfinex has decided to take a different approach than the one proffered by Poloniex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After much analysis, we have chosen to handle the accounting of margin trading and funding based on the model of how stock spinoffs, dividends, and distributions are handled in equity markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Specifically, in the case of a hardfork event, &lt;strong&gt;lenders will receive both BTC and BTU&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Anyone that is short BTC/USD or long any BTC trading pair (ETH/BTC, LTC/BTC, etc.) [that is, borrowing BTC] will owe BTU to the lender, effectively making the user short BTU. An exception is in the case that BTC is borrowed but not in use as margin collateral, in which case BTU accrues to the lender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Users that are margin long BTC/USD or short any BTC trading pair will receive BTU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR;&lt;/strong&gt; Both coins listed. If you are borrowing BTC for your margin position, you &lt;strong&gt;don’t&lt;/strong&gt; own coins from the new chain for your borrowed coins. If you are lending out BTC to other people, you own the new chain’s coins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement of several exchanges regarding the listing of coins of both chains is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scribd.com/document/342194766/Hardfork-Statement-3-17-11-00am&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No new contingency statement has been released regarding the Jihan Wu drama, in May though PGP said Bitfinex might list a BIP148 token trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6dcrim/bitfinex_is_likely_going_to_list_a_bip148_chain/&quot;&gt;Bitcoin is likely going to list a BIP148 token&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kraken&quot;&gt;Kraken&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kraken has not released any statement statement regarding bitcoin fork (not now and not for the Unlimited drama), but the exchange was signed in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scribd.com/document/342194766/Hardfork-Statement-3-17-11-00am&quot;&gt;BCC/BCU agreement&lt;/a&gt; alongside Bitfinex so it is likely their plan will be the same: both coins listed, borrowed bitcoins don’t own new chain. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.kraken.com/post/151941749242/on-the-imminent-ethereum-eth-hard-fork&quot;&gt;However, during the Ethereum network split Kraken did not support ETC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;exchanges-with-no-lending&quot;&gt;Exchanges with no lending&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bitstamp&quot;&gt;Bitstamp&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitstamp is adding Litecoin on Monday the 19th of June 2017. In the statement that announced the LTC trading they also mentioned margin trading feature. It’s not clear whether there will also be lending like on Bitfinex or whether they will handle the funds privately like Kraken. Either way, for one public lending system is unlikely with their slow engines, and the whole margin function is not likely to be rolled out until it is clear whether there will be the split or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitstamp was also signed under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scribd.com/document/342194766/Hardfork-Statement-3-17-11-00am&quot;&gt;the agreement&lt;/a&gt; regarding BCC/BCU alongside Bitfinex or Kraken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bittrex&quot;&gt;Bittrex&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bittrex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004479127-Statement-about-potential-Bitcoin-hard-fork&quot;&gt;Statement from March 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bittrex would like to support both tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bittrex also signed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scribd.com/document/342194766/Hardfork-Statement-3-17-11-00am&quot;&gt;the agreement&lt;/a&gt; regarding BCC/BCU alongside Bitfinex or Kraken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;derivative-exchanges&quot;&gt;Derivative Exchanges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you trade futures or use them to hedge, you also need to know what your exchange will do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cryptofacilities&quot;&gt;Cryptofacilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptofacilities sent out their plan for bitcoin BCC/BCU hard fork &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/60xxe3/cryptofacilities_hard_fork_contingency_procedures/&quot;&gt;via email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Indices: Crypto Facilities would calculate a new XBZ/USD real-time index (for marking) and reference rate (for settlement), representing the combined price of XBT and XBU. All outstanding bitcoin Futures and Turbos would be marked to and settled on XBZ/USD. This means that they would reference the combined value of both tokens, such that the impact of a potential split of value is mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It may be operationally impossible to implement a XBZ/USD index without delay right after a fork. For as long as the integrity of the new index cannot be assured, we reserve the right to mark outstanding contracts manually or to suspend trading. We would strive to minimize any such interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All new maturities of bitcoin-related Futures would be listed on either of XBT or XBU, depending on what we deem to be the “major” token. We reserve the right to not list any new Futures for as long as no major token has emerged or to list Futures on both tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR;&lt;/strong&gt; Trading will be halted until a dominant chain emerges. All contracts will be settled to the combined dollar value of both chains once the network splits.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tezos fundraiser scheduled 1 July</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Tezos Foundation just sent out an email detailing the eagerly awaited ICO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://image.prntscr.com/image/XujkhUErQmCyI-hpq7qM2A.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;text-of-the-email&quot;&gt;Text of the email:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tezos Fundraiser scheduled for July 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a message from the Tezos foundation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tezos Foundation is pleased to announce that the legal structure of the Tezos Foundation, its fundraiser, and related contracts have been approved by the Swiss Foundation Supervisory Authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this regulatory stamp of approval, we are now excited to announce the official start of the &lt;strong&gt;Tezos fundraiser on Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 6 am UTC&lt;/strong&gt;. We chose this date to give everyone enough time to complete their funding arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe it’s important to do things right and protect our contributors and users from risk, which is why we went beyond current industry practice and waited to receive official approval before accepting contributions. We expect this high level of care to serve our technology, our community, and the world as we continue to build and grow this essential infrastructure for a free and prosperous society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For technical information on how to participate in the Tezos fundraiser, please always refer exclusively to the Tezos website at https://tezos.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contributions will open at https://tezos.com on July 1 at 6 am UTC&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition, we have approved our broker, &lt;strong&gt;Bitcoin Suisse&lt;/strong&gt;, to offer its customers participation in the Tezos fundraiser for a fee. Note that only Bitcoin Suisse and no other service has been approved to do so, and that using such a service requires you to trust the service provider with your private keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to contribute, only do so through our own website https://tezos.com once the fundraiser opens, or through &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bitcoinsuisse.ch/tezos&quot;&gt;https://www.bitcoinsuisse.ch/tezos&lt;/a&gt; starting today&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No other websites are authorized to provide information on Tezos or accept contributions to the Tezos fundraiser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To stay updated with developments, sign up for the mailing list at https://tezos.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tezos Foundation is extremely pleased with the fantastic community that is starting to sprout around the Tezos project. The interest in the Tezos fundraiser has been electrifying. It is an amazing vote of confidence in decentralized governance and in the world class team developing the project. That interest has been matched by engineering development resulting in a testnet that has been operating for several months already and a production version that is expected to ship later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many thanks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Johann, Guido, Diego, and the Tezos Foundation team&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: If you intend to participate through Bitcoin Suisse rather than directly through https://tezos.com, bear in mind that funding arrangements can take longer than expected - in some cases, two weeks or longer. So if you want to ensure your participation, you should start the process immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-fees-and-all&quot;&gt;The fees and all&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some information about the Bitcoin Suisse way: There is a fee of 100 CHF (cca 100USD) and 1.25% fee on the money you want to contribute. You have to AML/KYC with your ID, selfie with ID and proof of address. They say they are getting a lot of requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To look at the numbers, if you want to send them 10K in bitcoins, your fee will be about 225 USD. You can also send them Ether or several kinds of fiat but in that case expect more haircut as the ICO is on BTC blockchain and all contributions will be changed into bitcoins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you get for this fee in pre-sale is that you are guaranteed to be put in the blocks that get a bonus:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tezos ICO is capped by transactions that will make it in between the first 2000 blocks after opening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;BTC Block # Bonus   XTZ/BTC
0-399       20%     6’000
400-799     15%     5’750
800-1’199   10%     5’500
1’200-1’599 5%      5’250
1’600-1’999 0%      5’000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for one bitcoin invested you are kind-of guaranteed to receive at least 5250 tezzies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not clear how they are planning to do it, overpaying the fees on bundled transactions or what, to get the transactions confirmed, but that is the phrasing of it in the agreement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Contributors who have signed up with and participate through Bitcoin Suisse AG, and who have completed their onboarding and funding at least 4 hours prior to the applicable rounds, is guaranteed participation in the “bonus” phase of the respective rounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;N.B: In case of force majeure, no guarantees regarding allocation or pricing of tokens are applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;N.B: Exact conditions regarding the crowd sale may be subject to change from the side of TZ and founders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Force majeure means ‘unforeseeable circumstances that prevent someone from fulfilling a contract’. That’s a normal condition to have in a contract but at the same time there is always a lot of unforeseeable circumstances in crypto.&lt;/p&gt;
